    <h1>The history</h1>
    <h2>

All you really need to know is that sometime around 2010, a sad-looking cartoon frog began to trend among posters on 4chan.org and similar “underground” imageboards.<br><br>

Shortly after, the age-old piece of online vernacular used to express laughter—”LOL”—fell out of favor on these sites.<br><br>

In its place a new slang term of synonymous meaning rose to common use: “KEK.”<br><br>

It comes from an odd technicality involving the Korean language and the popular video game World of Warcraft.<br><br> </h2>

       <h1>kek</h1>
       <h2>Esoteric Kekism", or the Cult of Kek, is a term for the parody religion of worshipping Pepe the Frog, which sprang from the similarity of the slang term for laughter, "kek", and the name of the ancient Egyptian frog god of darkness, Kek.<br><br> This deity, in turn, was associated with Pepe the Frog on internet forums. The internet meme has its origin on the internet message forum 4chan and other chans, and the board /pol/ in particular. Kek references are closely associated with Trump and the alt-right.</h2>

In real life they have been in many battles with Antifa in towns like Berkeley California and Boston.

In each attempt they succeeded to hold back the Liberals against over wealming odds even to having their main general arrested during the Third battle of Berkeley At the Free speech rally. Kekistan liberated the town shortly afterwards.
